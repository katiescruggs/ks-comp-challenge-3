# ks-comp-challenge-3

For this static comp challenge, my main goals were to re-create the original layout as closely as possible without receiving hex-codes or assets and to design a reasonable mobile layout for a website with a lot of content. For the mobile layout, I focused on leaving as much of the content accessible as possible while removing some options and placing them into dropdown menus for a less cluttered appearance.
